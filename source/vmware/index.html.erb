					<h2>Rock Solid Stability</h2>

					<p>
					The VMware hypervisor has been in production use since 1999.
					All their products share the same, robust core that powers
					the world's largest organizations. With the VMware provider, Vagrant
					now runs on the strength of the same foundation.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="span6">
					<h2>Uncompromised Portability</h2>

					<p>
					VMware virtual machines run on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux.
					Vagrant is starting with support for Fusion (Mac OS X), but
					support for other operating systems is on the way.
					</p>
				</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="span6">
					<h2>Professional Support</h2>

					<p>
					Every purchase of the Vagrant VMware Fusion provider comes with
					direct email support. VMware Fusion itself is eligible for
					professional support from VMware. Someone always has your back
					in case things aren't working as well as they should be.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="span6">
					<h2>&hearts; Open Source</h2>

					<p>
					Vagrant is free and open source. While the VMware Fusion provider
					is not, the revenue is used to continue to develop, support,
					and grow Vagrant and the community around it.
